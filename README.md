# Pizza Orders System

This is a simple app developed in lubuntu operation system, using pthread library and mutexes. It was an assignment in "operation systems" course to help us understand how a system uses multithreading to complete different tasks and processes. 

Each folder has a .h file where some constant data are declared, a .c file for the main code and a .sh file for autorunning the app in lubuntu terminal.

Pizza2 is an updated pizza1 app version where the system supports delivery as an option of pizza orders, while in the first version system only supports take-away orders.
