# pizza-multithreading

This is a simple app implementation in lubuntu operation system, using pthread library and mutexes. It was an assignment in "operation systems" course in order to help us to understand how a sytem uses multithreading to complete different tasks and processes. 

Each folder has a .h file where some constant data are declared, a .c file for the main code and a .sh file for autoruning the app in lubuntu terminal.

Pizza2 is an updated pizza1 app version where the system supports delivery as an option of pizza orders, while in the first version system only supports take-away orders.
